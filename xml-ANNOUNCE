The VFS represents tags as directories; the directories are numbered to
distinguish tags with the same name; also numbering helps to sort tags by their
order in XML instead of sorting them by name. Attributes, text nodes and
comments are represented as text files; attributes are shown in a file named
"attributes", attributes are listed in the file as name=value lines (I
deliberately ignore a small chance of newline characters in values); names and
values are reencoded to the console encoding. Text nodes and comments are
collected in a file named "text", stripped and reencoded. The filesystem is
read-only.

The VFS was inspired by a FUSE xmlfs: https://github.com/halhen/xmlfs
