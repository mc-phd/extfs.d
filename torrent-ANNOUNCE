   Installation instructions: http://phdru.name/Software/mc/INSTALL.html


The VFS lists all files and directories from the torrent metafile; all files
appear empty, of course, but the sizes are shown. Filenames are reencoded from
the metafile's encoding/codepage to the current locale.

Along with the files/directories in the torrent metafile the VFS also presents
meta information - in the form of files in .META directory. The size and
contents of these files are taken from the corresponding fields in the torrent
metafile. The script doesn't check if the torrent consists of a .META file or
directory (quite unlikely).

Date/time for all files is set to midnight of the 1st January of the current
year. The filesystem is, naturally, read-only.
