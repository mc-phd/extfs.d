How to install an external VFS script
=====================================

Related to extfs installation there are two major versions of ``Midnight
Commander``. Older versions before 4.7.something use ``extfs.ini``
configuration file. Newer versions simply allow to drop a VFS script to
``$HOME/.mc/extfs.d`` directory. One can distinguish these versions by
looking up the file ``extfs.ini``; run the following command from the
command line::

  locate -b \\extfs.ini

(I use GNU locate conventions; adapt the command line to your system;
the simplest variant is just ``locate extfs.ini``.)

Usual places for ``extfs.ini`` are ``/etc/mc/extfs/extfs.ini``,
``/usr/lib/mc/extfs/extfs.ini``, ``/usr/share/mc/extfs/extfs.ini`` or
``/usr/local/share/mc/extfs/extfs.ini``.

Older versions - extfs.ini
--------------------------

On the system where there is a file extfs.ini a VFS script has to be
installed the following way. Put the script into the system extfs
directory - ``/usr/share/mc/extfs/`` or ``/usr/local/share/mc/extfs/``.
Make the script executable. Edit ``extfs.ini`` - add a line naming the
script; for example, if one's installing xml VFS one has to do something
like::

  cd /etc/mc/extfs
  echo xml >>extfs.ini

To use the installed VFS one also has to edit ``$HOME/.mc/mc.ext`` to assign
the VFS to file extension(s) or type(s).

To enable file types add or change the following configuration option in
ini file in section ``[Midnight-Commander]``::

  use_file_to_guess_type=1

This has to be done using text editor - ``mc`` doesn't allow editing the
option in its configuration editor.

Newer versions - \$HOME/.mc/extfs.d
-----------------------------------

For newer versions just drop a VFS script to ``$HOME/.mc/extfs.d`` or
``$HOME/.local/share/mc/extfs.d/`` directory (verify directory by running
``mc -F``). Make the script executable. Edit ``mc.ext``. Enable file types
guessing (see above).
