   Manipulate a cell phone's filesystem in Midnight Commander using obexftp

WHAT'S NEW in version 1.2.4 (2007-06-12)
   Minor misspelling fix.

WHAT'S NEW in version 1.2.3 (2005-11-24)
   Put error logfile in the same directory as the transport file. If the
directory or the file is not writeable - try to put the logfile in a temporary
directory, usually /tmp.
   Get preferred charset from the current locale and encode unicode fullpath
from XML to that charset.
   Some errors are critical errors. More documentation.


WHAT'S NEW in version 1.2.0 (2004-09-27)
   Fixed a major bug with blocked read from a pipe. Many thanks to
Marius Konitzer <m.konitzer@gmx.de> for reporting the bug. Now I use files
instead of pipes.
   More test during parsing of a transport file.
